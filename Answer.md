Ans 1.) A foreign key constraint is a database rule that ensures that the value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must also exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. This will prevent you from creating products with invalid category IDs.

Ans 2.)  A CHECK constraint is a database rule that allows you to specify a condition that must be met for all data inserted into the column. In this case, the condition could be that the value in the "category_id" column must exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table.
